I live in Montreal, Canada. We don't have many options when it comes to classified ads and funny enough, the same applies for websites for real estate rentals. There is this ad ridden website called [kijiji](kijiji.com) that seems to be the only viable option.

I have many problems with this site but for the time being I will like to address one in particular that sparked my interest a few months ago. Their notification system is terrible. They'll send you an email once a day (if you're lucky) or sometimes every two or three days. Their email will allegedly include new results that match your search criteria. Most of the time these new results would be a few days old. This seems pretty useless to me if you're looking for a good deal and want to be the first one to get it.

I've been working on another project called [Moving Day](https://movingday.netlify.app/) where one of the features I want to include (eventually) is a real time notification system. So I had some code that I hadn't implemented when coincidentally a client asked for pretty much that feature for a freelance job. Long story short, I worked on it. The guy ghosted me but I had the app working and I would like to share it with the world.
