**Welcome to my blog**

Thanks for dropping by!

I want to make a commitment with myself that I'll post at least one blog entry per week. The fact is that I work every day on various projects but rarely finish a week with some sense of completion. I guess the best way to fix this is to publish what I've been up to and eventually figure out something useful to share with the world.

What is this? Some sort of documental archive? Well maybe it is...

**Moving Day**

This week I will be working on my app called [Moving Day](https://movingday.netlify.app/). I'll write a separate entry that explains the whole project, but for now I will work on the offline version of the site.

My goal is to have a finished looking site that is accessible even if you don't run the local server for the web scraper.

Thanks for reading ðŸ§¡

\- Alejandro
