## Conclusion

I started the sprint wanting to learn about brand strategy. Right away, **I came to realize that the community around the course would be just as important to the experience as the curriculum.** At this point it's been a week since we started the sprint. So many interesting discussions have sparked on the Slack workplace that it's hard to keep up. But knowing that there's such a positive energy from the start, makes me want to go even further.

**This year has been challenging for everyone, no doubt about it. But what I've learned from this analysis, makes me very hopeful for the future.**

I'm **excited** to be part of this **great** community of **creative** people, I want to learn more and I'd **love** to **help** as much as possible. I'll be talking to you after lunch ðŸ˜‰
