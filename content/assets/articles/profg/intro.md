Being part of Prof G's brand strategy sprint has been unique from day one. **It's been a huge opportunity to meet people from very diverse backgrounds.** We come together because we're embracing change and want to be part of this massive learning experience.

On the first day of the sprint we were added to the Slack workspace. Here we were greeted by the awesome TAs and admins that would help us through the course. There was a channel called #networking where the welcome message was: _**"Share a quick intro about who you are, what you do, and why youâ€™re here."**_ I quickly realized that there were over a thousand participants in the community!

I was ecstatic to meet so many leaders and I wanted to learn more. Unfortunately, **in matter of hours it was impossible to keep up with the messages.** There where more than 500 messages posted in the #networking channel within the span of 24 hours.

Fun fact: **it would take an average reader 2.8 hours to go through every message.** I wanted to understand the group a bit better, or at least be able to get an overview of what was going on. Luckily, machines are really good at processing data.

We crunched the numbers and came up with some very interesting results.
