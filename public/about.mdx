### My quick story

**Since I was 13, coding has been my passion.** It all began in 8th grade when my dad challenged me to learn JavaScript in exchange for his iPhone 4. **What started as a incentive quickly turned into a deep-seated love for technology and development.**

I began with Android application development, where I honed my skills in creating user-friendly mobile apps. This foundation led me to explore data science, where I discovered the power of analyzing and interpreting data to drive decision-making and innovation.

Eventually, my journey brought me to the exciting fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Here, I found my niche, developing cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible. Each step of my journey has been driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to build and create.

### As a developer

**I prioritize keeping the code concise and clear**, with thorough comments. My approach is to first develop a proof of concept (POC) and, once it proves successful, meticulously organize and refine the code to ensure it's easily understandable for future collaborators.

**I highly value the scalability and modularity of code**, ensuring it can be reused across various use cases. In AI, our work often begins with research followed by implementation. To better understand the dimensions of inputs and outputs, I frequently code and implement small parts of research papers.

I am always eager to engage in projects across diverse domains, leveraging AI to provide innovative solutions. Exploring new fields is both fascinating and rewarding, **offering valuable opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.**

### As a person

I deeply value human connection and naturally enjoy **helping others.** Skilled at explaining concepts, I have embraced lifelong learning, driven by the dynamic nature of my field, **making me a go-to resource for assistance and information**.

### As a colleague

I believe in **capitalizing on each team member's strengths** while supporting them in areas needing improvement, fostering a collaborative and balanced work environment.

Drawing from my experience teaching classmates, **I excel at simplifying complex concepts with easy and relatable examples**, ensuring everyone grasps the material effectively.

As a former team leader at ERETS Space Research, **I have a knack for understanding team members' preferences and motivations**, fostering a positive team spirit and ensuring everyone feels valued and engaged.

My experience in startups has honed my communication skills, enabling me to effectively understand clients' requirements and **facilitate seamless communication between clients and the development team.**

I enjoy boosting team morale by sharing my passion for music during meetings, **playing guitar to energize and inspire my colleagues.**

**I'm eager to connect and collaborate â€“ reach out!**
